# Driving is hard

This game was made for the Hack Club Arcade Jam in a little over 4 days. I joined the game jam late, so I unfortunately wasn't able to finish everything I wanted to, but I had a lot of fun learning how to use Godot and making this game!  

The game is about finding loopholes in a set of parking laws that slowly gets stricter as the game progresses. Instructions are in the game. 

Thanks for playing!  

## How to play
The game is made with Godot, and I included builds for Windows, Linux, and web.   

You can play the game in your browser [here](https://glitch752.github.io/DrivingIsHard/DrivingIsHard-web.html), but the performance is **terrible** and the graphics are broken in many places. I unfortunately didn't have time to fix these issues.  

I **highly** recommend downloading the builds for Windows or Linux. They run 30x faster on my machine (144fps vs ~5fps).
